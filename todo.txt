To Do
=====

- limit graph to the last 3-4 weeks
- get hover working to show metadata (sleep hours, etc.)
- restrict the number of visible to dates 28 days (possibly add a feature later to allow user selectable date range)
- find a way to allow the user to click on the mood graph node or otherwise select a date to bring up the sleep/meds entries for that particular day) so that they can see how those two key elements relate to or affect the recorded mood.
- potentially re-introduce the other graph types, or just display those analysis in text below the main graph (kind of like a dashboard indicating the average positive/negative/netural moods as percentage, etc).
- dump to image or pdf so reports can be printed
- add multi-user ability/login/etc.
- limit entries to one per day

minor stuff
===========

- clean up sass
- make the responsive more robust/thorough


maybes for down the road
========================
- refactor with Vue.js or Ember.js
- refactor with active node.js server (last step, if it can actually be deployed and used by others)
- port to android and/or ios
- more advanced data analysis and predictive tips
